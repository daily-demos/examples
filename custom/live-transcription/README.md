- Integrates Deepgram transcription service into Daily calls
- Listen for incoming transcription messages using the call object `app-message` event
- Extend the basic call demo with a transcription provider and aside
- Show a notification bubble on transcript tray button when a new message is received

Please note: this demo is not currently mobile optimised

### Getting started

```
# set both DAILY_API_KEY and DAILY_DOMAIN
mv env.example .env.local

yarn
yarn workspace @custom/live-transcription dev
```

### Setting up transcription

For testing the transcription service, you will have to register for a Deepgram API key and configure your Daily domain with that key. Get instructions under `enable_transcription` in our [domain configuration documentation](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/your-domain/config).

## How does this example work?

In this example we extend the [basic call demo](../basic-call) with the ability to generate transcription of the meeting in real time and log that in a side panel.

We pass a custom tray object, a custom app object (wrapping the original in a new `TranscriptionProvider`) as well as add our `TranscriptionAside` panel. We also symlink both the `public` and `pages/api` folders from the basic call.

Single live transcription is only available to call owners, you must create a token when joining the call.
